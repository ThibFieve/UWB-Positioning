__Project__: Ultra wide band (UWB) indoor positioning system.

Project in the scope of the course of signal processing from UCLouvain. 

__Tasks:__ The goal was to track the position of an indoor transmitter, surrounded by 5 receivers. The received signals, by each antenna, and the original signal generated by the moving object were provided. We had to recreate the path the transmitter made over time and compare it to its real track.
The signals were provided to us as well as a laser tracking of the actual positions.
The goal was to perform signal processing and correlation to be able to track the object via time difference of arrival (TDOA). All the code for signal processing had to be hand made and written on Matlab.

__Result:__ We managed to implement an Ultra-wide band positioning and tracking of an object in an indoor environment using TDOA, Hand crafted Outliers sorting algorithm, and signal processing methods.
